## 🏗 Technical Deep Dive

### Hybrid Rendering Strategy

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Used for the Product List and Product Detail pages to ensure optimal SEO and fast initial load times (First Contentful Paint).
- **Client-Side Rendering (CSR)**: Used for interactive components like the Cart, Favorites drawer, and dynamic filtering to provide a snappy, app-like experience.

### State Management (Redux Toolkit)

The application state is managed using Redux Toolkit with a normalized structure:

- **Products Slice**: Handles fetching, caching, and state of product data.
- **Cart & Favorites Slices**: Manage user selections with automatic LocalStorage synchronization.
- **UI Slice**: Controls global UI state like search queries and pagination.

### Design System

A custom Material UI theme is implemented with:

- **Typography**: Inter font family with carefully selected weights.
- **Palette**: A vibrant color scheme featuring purple-blue gradients (`#667eea` → `#764ba2`) and functional status colors.
- **Glassmorphism**: Extensive use of `backdrop-filter` and semi-transparent backgrounds for a modern aesthetic.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- [x] User Authentication & Profiles (Mock Implementation)
- [ ] Payment Gateway Integration
- [ ] Order History & Tracking
- [ ] Dark Mode Support

## 📚 What I Learned

This project has been an incredible learning journey that significantly improved my frontend development skills. Here are the key technologies and concepts I mastered:

### 🎯 Core Technologies

- **Next.js 16 App Router**: Learned the modern file-based routing system, server/client component patterns, and how to leverage SSR/CSR effectively for optimal performance.
- **Redux Toolkit**: Gained deep understanding of state management, creating slices, async thunks, and managing complex application state in a scalable way.
- **TypeScript**: Improved type safety skills, creating interfaces, type definitions, and ensuring robust code quality throughout the application.

### 🔧 Advanced Concepts

- **API Integration with Axios**: Learned to create custom Axios instances with base configurations (baseURL, timeout, headers) and manage API calls efficiently across the application.
- **LocalStorage Persistence**: Learned how to synchronize Redux state with browser storage for persistent user data across sessions.
- **Feature-Based Architecture**: Understood how to structure large applications using modular, feature-based organization for better maintainability.
- **Material UI v7**: Developed expertise in using MUI components, customizing themes, and creating responsive, accessible user interfaces.

### 💡 Best Practices

- **Error Handling**: Implemented global error boundaries and user-friendly error states.
- **Performance Optimization**: Applied debouncing, lazy loading, and efficient rendering strategies.
- **Code Organization**: Learned to separate concerns with services, utilities, and component-based architecture.
- **User Experience**: Created loading states, skeleton screens, and smooth transitions for better UX.

This project has been instrumental in my growth as a developer, helping me understand real-world application development patterns and modern React ecosystem best practices.
